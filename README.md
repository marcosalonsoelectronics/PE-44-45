Closed-loop Response of a DC-DC Converter … and why it won’t be as expected (I and II)

PE-44 available at: https://youtu.be/GiVOKpgZ3eI

This video shows how to obtain the closed-loop control-to-output response of a DC-DC converter by theoretical analysis and by LTspice simulation. The video also highlights small differences between the theoretical response and the response obtained from the simulation and poses a question to the viewers to investigate the reason of these differences. The answer to this question will be revealed in the next video PE45.

This video shows how to obtain the closed-loop control-to-output response of a DC-DC converter by theoretical analysis and by LTspice simulation. The video also highlights small differences between the theoretical response and the response obtained from the simulation. This second part explains the reason why the simulation response is different from the theoretical response.
